# Release Hostory:
- v.0.1 [20200728] - First Release
  - 20200810 - def "init http headers" was rollback + added some additional parameters in demo variable yaml
  - when we create new device, you can't provision Primary Mng IP. It needs to be first create device / then create IP address assign to managment device / 
    and then this IP can be assign as primary - I implement _patch function which will automaticly set managment IP after create Managment IP assign to em0 Managment Port.
